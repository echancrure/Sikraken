% lazy_reach_store.pl
% ECLiPSe Prolog â€” Option A implemented with store-based bitsets (complete file)
%
% Usage:
%  - Either assert edge/3 and function_call/3 facts, then call build_graph/0
%  - Or call build_graph_from_lists(BaseEdges, CallEdges)
%  - Use edge_reaches_uncovered(EdgeOrId) to test pruning
%  - Use cover_edge(EdgeOrId) or cover_edges(List) to mark edges covered
%
% This file uses:
%   - assoc for maps (id_map, adjacency)
%   - store for mutable sparse bitsets (reachability caches and uncovered set)
%
% Notes:
%  - Edges are terms edge(Src,Dst,Label). Function calls are converted to
%    synthetic edges function_call(From, To, Label) are included in indexing.
%  - Reachability bitset for an edge is computed lazily on first need and cached.
%  - The uncovered set is a store where a key Id has value 1 when uncovered,
%    and 0 or absent when covered.
%  - No assert/retract in hot path except for the reach cache (could be replaced
%    by setval/assoc if preferred).
